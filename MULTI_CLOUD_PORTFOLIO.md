## 🎯 Interview Talking Points

### **"Why Multiple Clouds?"**
> "I believe in choosing the right tool for the job. AWS excels at monitoring and has the most mature ecosystem, while GCP has superior Kubernetes integration and security tools. This approach shows I can adapt to any environment and make strategic technology decisions."

### **"How Do You Handle Multi-Cloud Complexity?"**
> "Each project demonstrates different aspects of cloud management. Project 2 shows AWS monitoring expertise, while Project 4 showcases GCP security capabilities. I use infrastructure-as-code and consistent deployment patterns to manage complexity."

### **"What's Your Cloud Strategy?"**
> "I'm cloud-agnostic but platform-aware. I choose AWS for monitoring because of CloudWatch and extensive integrations, GCP for Kubernetes because of GKE's superior implementation, and GitHub Actions for CI/CD because it's platform-neutral."
